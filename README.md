# Encapsulation-in-JAVA
encapsulation is an Object-Oriented Programming concept that refers to the bundling of data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. Encapsulation also hides the internal state of the object from the outside world, providing controlled access through public methods.
